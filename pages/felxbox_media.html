                  <p>Daniel Joseph Ricciardo (born 1 July 1989) is an Italian-Australian racing driver who is currently competing in Formula One, under the Australian flag, for Renault.

                      Ricciardo joined Toro Rosso in 2012 full time after the team changed its driver lineup and drove a Ferrari-powered car for them in 2012 and 2013.
                       In 2014, Ricciardo was promoted to Red Bull alongside multiple time world champion Sebastian Vettel.
                        In his first season with Red Bull under Renault power, Ricciardo finished third in the championship with his first three Formula One wins, in Canada, Hungary, and Belgium.
